However the first electronic digital computer were developed between 1940 and 1945 in the United States and in the United Kingdom. They were gigantic, originally the size of a large room, and also need to be supply a large amount of power source which is equivalent as several hundred modern personal computers. The history of computer hardware covers the developments from simple devices to aid calculation, to mechanical calculators, punched card data processing and on to modern stored program computers. The tools or mechanical tool used to help in calculation are called calculators while the machine operator that help in calculations is called computer.

       <H4>n the 1950's two devices would be invented that would improve the computer field and set in motion the beginning of the computer revolution. The first of these two devices was the transistor. Invented in 1947 by William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain of Bell Labs, the transistor was fated to oust the days of vacuum tubes in computers, radios, and other electronics.

Vaccum Tubes
The vacuum tube, used up to this time in almost all the computers and calculating machines, had been invented by American physicist Lee De Forest in 1906. The vacuum tube, which is about the size of a human thumb, worked by using large amounts of electricity to heat a filament inside the tube until it was cherry red. One result of heating this filament up was the release of electrons into the tube, which could be controlled by other elements within the tube. De Forest's original device was a triode, which could control the flow of electrons to a positively charged plate inside the tube. A zero could then be represented by the absence of an electron current to the plate;

   <h4>With nothing being mechanically driven, the term flash drive is a bit of a misnomer. It is called a drive because to users and computers alike, information stored there is accessed the same way as if it were the actual hard drive on a computer. These are important because they can go wherever the artist is and if there is a port to plug into, to obtain whatever information the user wants to take back to the main computer. Of course, computers need the motherboards, especially if the user desires to add additional memory or a different type of sound card. Motherboards are where everything happens, basically. This is the brain of the computer, whether one has Windows 2000, Windows Vista or Macs. Every single one of them has a motherboard. Also something needed by computers, for the most part, are keyboards, whether they are wired or wireless, a mouse, again, wired or wireless and a microphone, to enhance the audio on the developing sites. As new computers are designed and delivered to both the professional and the general public, current input/output devices will change, as well. The touch screen, for example, pretty much does away with the need for a mouse. Voice recognition software may replace the keyboard someday. While change is good, especially for the environment, change is often a hard pill to take, especially if one is trained using keyboards, mice, pens and tablets. The good
